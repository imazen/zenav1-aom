test:
    cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast

# SCALAR-PIN mode: AOM_FORCE_SCALAR disables every archmage SIMD token
# process-wide (crates/aom-dispatch), so every kernel dispatch falls through
# to the scalar port. The full suite passing here proves SIMD work left the
# scalar path untouched. Run BOTH `just test` AND `just test-scalar` before
# landing any kernel change.
test-scalar:
    AOM_FORCE_SCALAR=1 cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast

# FAST full-suite run — identical coverage to `just test`, built at opt-level 3
# (the `test-fast` profile) so the e2e byte gates (real full encodes/decodes,
# minutes each unoptimized) run far quicker. debug-assertions + overflow-checks
# stay on, integer results are identical (byte gates stay byte-exact). The
# first run pays a one-time optimized compile; reruns are fast. Use this for
# routine "did I break anything" checks; `just test` remains the debug default.
test-fast:
    cargo test --profile test-fast --workspace --no-fail-fast

# FAST scalar-pin run (AOM_FORCE_SCALAR, opt-level 3). Pair with `test-fast`
# for the both-dispatch-modes parity gate at a fraction of the debug wall time.

# FASTEST full-suite run — same coverage as `just test-fast`, but scheduled by
# cargo-nextest. Stock `cargo test` drains test BINARIES sequentially, threading
# only within each one; nextest puts every test across every binary into ONE
# global work pool. That matters here because the cost is wildly concentrated:
# aom-decode sums to 458s with 364s (80%) in a single binary, and aom-dsp is 57s
# across 95 binaries with most at ~0.00s.
#
# MEASURED 2026-07-19 (aom-dsp, 342 tests / 95 binaries, run-only wall):
#   cargo test sequential  57.02s | nextest  12.07s  = 4.7x, within 7% of the
#   floor (the slowest single test, dv_ref_diff::find_samples_matches_c 11.31s).
# A pool cannot beat its slowest single test — see benchmarks/test_cycle_time_
# 2026-07-19.md for why binary consolidation and lld were measured and rejected.
#
# Needs cargo-nextest (prebuilt: curl -LsSf https://get.nexte.st/latest/linux
# | tar zxf - -C ~/.cargo/bin). CI still uses plain `cargo test`.
test-next:

# Where is the suite time actually going? Prints the 25 slowest tests. nextest
# reports per-test timing, which stock libtest will not on stable — this is how
# you find the long poles worth splitting.

# QUICK SIMD-parity subset (opt-level 3) — the Gate-3 kernel crates' per-kernel
# SIMD==scalar differentials + the transform 2-D permutation-equality gate,
# WITHOUT the minutes-long encoder e2e gates. For tight iteration on SIMD /
# transform work; run `just test-fast` + `just test-fast-scalar` before landing.
# Measured 2026-07-17: ~45s cold (optimized build-dominated), test-RUN a few
# seconds — the transform per-kernel differential is 1.5s here vs ~10s in debug.
