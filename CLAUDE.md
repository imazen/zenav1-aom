# aom-rs — project instructions & durable bug log

Pure-Rust, **bit-exact** reimplementation of libaom ≥ v3.14.1 as a drop-in replacement.
Validated behind differential harnesses against the REAL exported C functions (priority of
evidence: real exported C fn > synthetic-facade-over-real-fn > verbatim transcription —
transcribed oracles can carry shared bugs).

**Module-progress source of truth:** `STATUS.md` (updated per landing by the track agents).
**This file** holds project-level coordination rules + the durable **Known Bugs** log.

## Gates (definition of done)

- **Gate 1 — Decoder:** bit-identical to C across the AV1 conformance corpus (intra scope
  wired in CI: `xtask/conformance.py --fetch --scope intra`; gate = byte-identity + golden MD5).
- **Gate 2 — Encoder:** bitstream bit-identical for every `--cpu-used 0..9`.
- **Gate 3 — Performance:** ≤ 1.20× C.
- **Gate 4 — Coverage checklist** (+ a zenavif integration gate).

Primary configuration: ALLINTRA (usage=2), speed-0 KEY frame. **Single-frame (KEY-frame)
work must reach byte-exactness across BOTH tracks before inter-frame ("the rest") starts.**

## Known Bugs

Record real bugs here immediately with file:line refs (survives context loss). Do NOT close
an entry by relaxing/excluding a test — only by a landed fix verified on `origin/main`.

### KB-1 — Decoder: recon divergence at base_qindex ≥ 249 (quantizer-62/-63) — REAL CORRUPTION, CI-quarantined
- **Symptom:** decoded RECON diverges from the C oracle at `base_qindex >= 249` — the
  `quantizer-62` / `quantizer-63` conformance vectors. Reproduces at **bd8 AND bd10, luma AND
  chroma**. Divergence is an edge-local ±1 prediction cascade.
- **Root cause (CONFIRMED via isolated C-decoder instrumentation):** NOT an entropy/coeff-value
  bug. The first 311 txb records dump byte-identical (plane, tx, eob, dc_sign_ctx, txb_skip_ctx,
  levels ALL match) — the per-txb entropy decoder + context maintenance are FAITHFUL. The bug is
  the **txb ITERATION ORDER for coding blocks >64×64**: C (`decodeframe.c:929-962`,
  `decode_token_recon_block` intra path) chunks each block into BLOCK_64X64 units and within each
  chunk iterates planes→txbs → **L,U,V interleaved per 64-unit**; the port iterates each plane
  across the WHOLE block (all luma txbs, then all chroma) in `aom-decode/src/lib.rs` (~2235 luma
  loop + separate chroma loop). Identical for ≤64×64 blocks; for 128-sized blocks it desyncs the
  arithmetic decoder and everything cascades (the "edge-local ±1" symptom). Only q62/q63 pick
  partitions >64×64 (flat high-q blocks) → exact q61→q62 threshold. **Fix:** wrap luma+chroma
  reconstruction in the outer 64×64-chunk loop, plane-interleaved, matching C.
  (Earlier "entropy coefficient-decode path" localization was one layer too low.)
- **Fix #1 (VERIFIED, awaiting workspace-compile to land):** the reorder is implemented in
  `aom-decode/src/lib.rs` and proven — b10-q63 now byte-matches C and the port's 328 KEY-frame
  txb reads are byte-identical (up from the record-311 desync). The reorder is correct.
- **Bug #2 = CDEF per-unit strength stamping for >64 blocks (ROOT CAUSE CORRECTED — NOT intra-pred).**
  Exposed by fix #1; b8-q62 / b8-q63 / b10-q62 failed edge-local ±1 (b10-q63 clean). Intra-pred was
  DISPROVEN: the port's predict params for the failing 2nd 64×64 unit match C exactly (DC_PRED,
  n_top=64, n_left=32) and the DC math + left-column extension match C's `build_intra_predictors`
  line-for-line — pred+residual reconstruct the unit correctly. The scattered ±1 across a whole
  64×64 unit is CDEF's signature. C reads the CDEF strength once per 64×64 unit and stores it on the
  block's SHARED MB_MODE_INFO (`decodemv.c` read_cdef, stamped at the unit top-left mi); the frame
  walk reads it back per 64×64 unit top-left mi (`cdef.c:304`). A >64 block shares ONE mbmi across
  all its mi cells, so every covered 64×64 unit reads the same strength. The port
  (`aom-decode/src/frame.rs:1212`) stamped only the block's TOP-LEFT unit → other covered units
  stayed at −1 (CDEF skipped); for the 128-wide mi64,0 the 2nd unit (mi64,16) kept −1 so CDEF ran
  in C but not the port → the ±1. **Fix #2:** stamp `b.info.cdef_strength` on ALL 64×64 units the
  block covers (in-frame h×w extent); sub-64 blocks cover one unit, unchanged. Both bugs are
  >64-only, which is why exactly q62/q63 fail (only very high qindex picks >64 partitions).
- **Fix #1 + #2 VERIFIED GREEN (landing in one commit):** full conformance gate 269 in-scope frames,
  0 failures, WITH q60–q63 present; all four targets (b8/b10 × quantizer-62/63) byte-exact + golden
  MD5, plus 60/61 and everything else (allintra/size/intrabc/cdfupdate...), no ≤64 regression. The
  landing commit reverts the ci.yml q62/q63 rm, adds an explicit q62/q63 × bd8/bd10 regression test,
  and deletes the throwaway scratch. #21 closes only after: on origin, CI green WITH q62/63 restored,
  `merge-base --is-ancestor` confirmed.
- **Encoder cross-check (low priority):** the encoder pack must write txbs in the SAME
  64×64-chunk plane-interleaved order for >64 blocks. The encoder already byte-matches
  `diag+vbars16 256×256 cq63` (strong-LF gate 5/5), which is empirical evidence its order is
  correct — but confirm pack.rs's >64-block txb order once the decode-order fix lands.
- **CI status (TEMPORARY quarantine):** `.github/workflows/ci.yml:63-64` `rm`s the q62/q63
  vectors after fetch so Gate-1 goes green on the rest. This is a **must-fix corruption bug**
  under the zero-tolerance rule (wrong pixels are a shipping bug, never a known limitation),
  NOT an accepted limitation. The `rm` MUST be reverted in the same PR that lands the fix, and
  the specific q62/q63 vector(s) added as an explicit strong byte-identity case.
- **Tracking:** task **#21** (HIGH). Fix unblock: authorized throwaway reference-*decoder*
  instrumentation to dump the C coefficient + coeff-context/cdf state at the first diverging
  (position, plane, qindex), then revert + rebuild clean (never commit the instrument).
- **Range matters:** q62/q63 is the aggressive end of the quantizer range — exactly the
  web-compression regime this port targets.

### KB-2 — Encoder: `diag+vbars16 256x256 cq62` strong cell — FIXED ✅ (per-block intra edge filter type)
- **FIXED 2026-07-15.** Root cause: the port **never re-derived the intra edge filter type
  (`get_intra_edge_filter_type`, reconintra.c:974) per block** — it carried a frozen SB-level
  `filter_type` (always 0) down into every leaf's `TxfmYrdEnv`/`UvRdEnv`. C re-derives it per
  block from the live mode-info grid: `1` iff the above **or** left neighbour is a SMOOTH mode
  (SMOOTH_PRED=9 / SMOOTH_V_PRED=10 / SMOOTH_H_PRED=11). For the diverging cell, SB(32,32)'s
  VERT_4 strip-1 (16×64 @ mi(32,36)) has a **SMOOTH left neighbour** (strip-0, mode 9), so C
  computes `filter_type=1` while the port used `0`. That flips the intra-edge-filter strength for
  **angled** directional predictions (adj≠0; pure-vertical adj=0 skips the edge filter, which is
  why adj=0 matched exactly and only angled deltas diverged). The port's worse angled prediction
  raised V_PRED adj=−1's **model RD** to 25930 vs C's 24704; the `prune_intra_y_mode`
  `THRESH_BEST=1.5×best_model_rd` (=1.5×17236=25854) then **over-pruned adj=−1** in the port
  (25930>25854, margin 76) where C keeps it (24704<25854). C fully evaluates adj=−1, the ALLINTRA
  variance factor reorders it ahead of adj=0, and C picks adj=−1 → strip winner differs → HORZ_A
  vs VERT_4 → byte divergence. **Fix:** recompute `filter_type` per block from `above_mode`/
  `left_mode` (already read from the grid for the mode-cost context) in `partition_pick.rs`'s
  leaf search, mirroring `get_intra_edge_filter_type`; the `CPick` C-recursion reference in
  `partition_pick_diff.rs` got the identical recompute so the differential stays faithful.
- **Verified:** the cq62 cell now achieves TRUE END-TO-END BYTE MATCH vs real aomenc and is an
  **asserted** case in `encoder_gate_e2e_rich_content_strong_lf` (6/6); full `aom-encode` suite
  green; the port's angled prediction matches C pixel-for-pixel (per-tx-block SATDs identical).
- **Chroma follow-up (#26) — FIXED ✅ 2026-07-15.** The **chroma** `filter_type` (UvRdEnv) was the
  same frozen-at-0 bug on the UV plane: C's `get_intra_edge_filter_type(xd, plane=1)` is `1` iff an
  available above/left chroma neighbour's `uv_mode` is SMOOTH (UV_SMOOTH_PRED=9 / UV_SMOOTH_V=10 /
  UV_SMOOTH_H=11). Fix mirrors the KB-2 luma recompute on chroma: `ModeGrid` now carries a parallel
  `uv_modes` grid (`partition_pick.rs`, stamped alongside luma at every `stamp`/`stamp_grid_from_tree`
  site); `leaf_pick_sb_modes` recomputes the per-block chroma edge `filter_type` from the chroma
  neighbours (chroma-reference mi derivation, av1_common_int.h:1400-1416: `base=(mi_row-(mi_row&ss_y),
  mi_col-(mi_col&ss_x))`, above=`base+(-1,+ss_x)`, left=`base+(+ss_y,-1)`) and feeds it to BOTH the UV
  RD search AND — via the new `LeafWinner::uv_edge_filter_type` — the pack re-encode
  (`encode_b_intra_dry`, encode_sb.rs), which produces the coded chroma bytes. The `CPick`
  C-recursion reference in `partition_pick_diff.rs` got the identical recompute + a parallel `uv_grid`
  (randomized UV neighbours now exercise it as a differential witness). **Verified:** new
  `encoder_gate_444_bd8_chroma_edge_filter_witness` (encoder_gate_chroma_ss_e2e.rs) byte-matches real
  aomenc on all 4 cells WITH the fix and DIVERGES on the 128×128 cq12/cq32 cells with it reverted
  (proven fails-before/matches-after); `partition_pick_diff` passes with randomized smooth UV
  neighbours; full `aom-encode` suite green. Commit: partition_pick.rs + encode_sb.rs +
  partition_pick_diff.rs + encode_sb_diff.rs + the witness.
- **Historical isolation trail (how it was root-caused) below:**
- **Re-verified 2026-07-15 (still diverges), with much sharper isolation:**
  - Facts: qindex **249**, `screen_content=true` (auto-detected — the ONLY screen-content cell in
    the whole encoder suite), port tile **95 bytes vs real 100** (port codes FEWER symbols), port
    derives LF luma **[0,17]** vs real **[1,17]** (a DOWNSTREAM recon symptom, not the cause), first
    payload mismatch at byte 3 (= the header LF-level byte). First **TILE**-byte divergence is at
    **tile-byte 60 of 100** → the first ~60% of the tile is byte-identical, so the divergence is in a
    **MID-FRAME SB, NOT SB(0,0)** (unlike KB-3).
  - **RULED OUT — palette flag** (definitively): the port's RD `try_palette =
    allow_palette(allow_screen_content_tools, bsize)` (partition_pick.rs:589, no `enable_palette`
    gate) is EMPIRICALLY byte-exact — `encoder_gate_e2e_ab_attempt` is the exact
    `enable_palette=0`(standard shim) + `screen_content=1` config and byte-matches WITH it; forcing
    `try_palette=false` REGRESSED that gate. So real includes the palette-Y no-palette flag cost for
    screen-content frames regardless of `--enable-palette=0`, and the port matches. Write side
    (pack.rs:274, `allow_palette` only) matches C (bitstream.c:1042). Palette is fully correct.
  - **RULED OUT — all other screen-content RD effects** (parallel-agent survey of the sibling C,
    verified against build config): at speed-0 / full non-realtime build / ALLINTRA / KEY / qidx249 /
    <720p, there is **zero** screen-content dependence in rdmult (rd.c), quantizer (av1_quantize.c),
    coeff trellis (encodemb.c/txb_rdopt.c), tx-set context, angle-delta / filter-intra / smooth, or
    the partition search — beyond palette (handled) and the header intrabc-present bit (handled: AB
    gate proves the port's header writer emits it). The one latent tx path, `get_default_tx_type`
    forcing DCT_DCT under screen content (blockd.h:1175), is **dormant** because
    `use_intra_default_tx_only=0` in the non-realtime reference build (verified `CONFIG_REALTIME_ONLY
    0` + av1_cx_iface.c:374 default 0). RANK-3 `exhaustive_searches_thresh` differs at speed-0 but is
    inert (no motion search in all-intra). RC is bypassed (fixed AOM_Q, per-block qindex stays 249).
  - **CONCLUSION:** a plain **speed-0 coeff/partition/mode near-tie**, NOT screen-content-specific.
    Same content+generator as the cq**63** cell that byte-matches (strong_lf gate 5/5); cq62 → qidx
    249 tips a near-tie in a later SB. Class-identical to KB-1's "only very-high-qindex flips it".
  - **RD-DUMP DONE (2026-07-15) — root-caused to a single 16×64 leaf's tx/coeff evaluation.**
    Method: re-tailored sibling harness (`/root/libaom-enc-instrument/rd_harness.c`) for
    `diag+vbars16 256×256 cq62 cpu0` and VALIDATED its output == real (117-byte stream, frame OBU
    `32 69` payload = 5 hdr `44 f9 00 51 14` + 100 tile `ff 3b 14 51…`). Then per-SB partition dump
    (port PSB vs sibling C CSB): **15/16 SBs match; SB (mi=32,32) diverges — C picks PARTITION_HORZ_A
    (4), port picks PARTITION_VERT_4 (9).** Per-candidate RD at (32,32): port HORZ_A rate=33741
    dist=8751216 **rdcost=1393344729 == C's HORZ_A EXACTLY**; port VERT_4 rate=23037 dist=8757376
    **rdcost=1307466663 wins**. C's VERT_4 is INVALID: C's 4-way prune allows both HORZ4/VERT4
    (`allowed=[1,1]`, `prune_ext_partition_types_search_level=1` so the level-2 partitioning gate at
    partition_search.c:4202 does NOT fire — not a pruning diff), but C's VERT_4 sub-block search
    **bails at strip 2** (`rd_try_subblock` returns 0: strip-2's own 16×64 mode RD exceeds the
    remaining budget best−cum). **Per-strip VERT_4 at (32,32) (both mono, subsize=BLOCK_16X64=20):
    strip0 (c=32) mode=9 cum_rate=7557 cum_dist=3946048 — MATCHES C exactly; strip1 (c=36) SAME
    mode=1 (V_PRED) in both, but port Δrate=5614/Δdist=933472 vs C Δrate=9980/Δdist=1568992 — port
    UNDER-COMPUTES both.**
  - **EXACT ROOT CAUSE — angle_delta divergence on the strip-1 16×64 V_PRED leaf.** Both pick
    identical `tx_size=TX_16X64 (17)`, `skip=0`, `tt0=DCT_DCT`; the ONLY difference is the intra
    **angle_delta**: **C picks V_PRED `angle_delta=-1`, the port picks V_PRED `angle_delta=0`.** The
    port's adj=0 (rate 5614 / dist 933472) is strictly cheaper on BOTH axes than C's adj=-1 (rate
    9980 / dist 1568992) — so C's OWN adj=0 evaluation must be *worse* than the port's adj=0 (else C
    would pick 0). Both search the full delta range (`use_angle_delta` matches C exactly:
    `bsize>=BLOCK_8X8`, and 16×64=20 qualifies; port `enable_angle_delta=true` at speed 0). ⇒ the
    port's **directional-intra prediction and/or angle-delta RD for this 16×64 (1:4-aspect) leaf is
    wrong** — its adj=0 (or the delta search) is under-costed, so adj=0 wins in the port where adj=-1
    wins in C. (NOT partition pruning, NOT palette, NOT screen-content, NOT tx-size/type/skip, NOT
    #25's speed-1 bugs — this is speed-0.) strip0 (also 16×64, mode=9=D67_PRED-ish non-vertical)
    matching rules out a blanket 16×64 bug — it's specific to V_PRED angle_delta on this leaf.
  - **RESOLVED (see the FIXED block at the top of this entry).** The per-delta dump above was
    slightly mis-framed: adj=0 was **not** under-costed — it matched C exactly. The real mechanism
    is that the port never even *evaluated* adj=−1's full RD: it **model-pruned** adj=−1 at
    `prune_intra_y_mode` because its **model** RD (25930) was inflated by the wrong (0 instead of 1)
    intra edge filter type on the angled prediction, tipping it over `1.5×best_model_rd` (25854).
    The "directional-intra predictor edge/neighbour" guess was on target — it was the per-block
    `get_intra_edge_filter_type` recompute the port was missing. All temp instrumentation and the
    sibling `/root/libaom-enc-instrument` have been removed.

### KB-3 — Encoder: `vgrad 256x256 cq32` cpu-used=1 cell — FIXED (missing speed-1 `use_square_partition_only_threshold` rect-kill)
- **FIXED** (commit pending on origin): the cell now byte-matches; promoted to an asserted winner
  in `encoder_gate_speed1_textured_allintra` (14/14 cpu-used=1 content cells). Root-caused via
  **isolated sibling-libaom encoder instrumentation** (`/root/libaom-enc-instrument`, a throwaway
  copy — never the shared `reference/libaom`) dumping C's per-candidate RD at SB(0,0) 64×64 for
  the exact vgrad-256-cq32 encode. Findings: C's NONE and SPLIT RD matched the port **exactly**
  (NONE rate 36745 / dist 19456 / rdcost 7427690, rdmult 68796); C **never evaluated** the
  rectangular partitions, but the port did, and the port's HORZ (rdcost 7058801) beat NONE → port
  wrongly picked `PARTITION_HORZ`. C disables rect via the "square-partition-only" rect kill
  (`partition_search.c:5749`): `if (bsize > use_square_partition_only_threshold) {
  partition_rect_allowed[HORZ] &= !has_rows; [VERT] &= !has_cols; }`. That threshold is a
  framesize-DEPENDENT ALLINTRA speed feature: sub-480p it is `BLOCK_64X64` at speed 0 (so
  `bsize > 64X64` never holds in a ≤64 SB — why speed-0 never needed it) but drops to
  `BLOCK_32X32` at speed ≥ 1, killing rect on the 64X64 SB. **Fix:** wired the rect-kill into
  `rd_pick_partition_real` (`use_square_partition_only_threshold_allintra`, framesize+speed
  dependent), placed after `partition_rect_allowed` init and before the CNN prune (matching C's
  order). Speed-0 unaffected (threshold `BLOCK_64X64` → no-op); full `cargo test -p aom-encode`
  = 89 passed, 0 failed. NOT a learned-model prune (the CNN/prune_2d/etc. elimination below stands).
- **KB-2 is a SEPARATE root** (do NOT conflate): KB-2's cell runs at **cpu-used=0**, where this
  fix is a no-op (threshold `BLOCK_64X64`). KB-2 needs its own speed-0 root-cause pass.

<details><summary>Original isolation notes (superseded by the fix above)</summary>

Was: `vgrad 256×256 cq32` (base_qindex 128) diverged at byte 5, never re-converging.
- **Symptom:** in `encoder_gate_speed1_textured_allintra`, the `vgrad 256×256 cq32`
  (base_qindex 128) cell does not e2e byte-match aomenc. Diverges at **byte 5** (first
  tile-data byte) and **never re-converges** (`last_common_idx = 4` = last header byte) — an
  early partition/mode cascade at SB(0,0). Excluded (documented) in the winners list of that
  gate; the sibling cells (256×256 cq48, 128×128 cq32/cq48) all byte-match.
- **Isolation COMPLETE — NOT an unported learned-model prune.** The originally-suspected
  `intra_cnn_based_part_prune_level` 0→2 (intra CNN partition prune) is now **fully ported +
  wired** into `rd_pick_partition_real` (commit `a600394`) and its four flags are **bit-exact
  vs C** (`cnn_partition_decision_diff`). For this cell the CNN fires and sets
  `square_split_disabled=true` at every 64×64 SB root — **identically to C** — so it constrains
  port and C the same way and cannot cause a divergence. **Empirically confirmed:** wiring the
  CNN in left byte-5 (157 vs 8) byte-identical. Eliminated candidates (with evidence):
  `prune_2d_txfm_mode` PRUNE_2 (intra path needs `prune_tx_type_est_rd`, which is speed≥4;
  `prune_tx_2D` is `is_inter`-only); `model_based_prune_tx_search_level`,
  `av1_ml_predict_breakout`, `av1_ml_early_term_after_split`, `av1_ml_prune_rect_partition`,
  `simple_motion_search_*` (all `!frame_is_intra_only`); `ml_predict_var_partitioning` (nonrd).
- **Root cause (localized):** a **partition-search RD near-tie** (KB-2 class). The port picks
  `PARTITION_HORZ` for SB(0,0) (two 64×32 DC / TX_64X32 blocks); C picks a different partition.
  A speed-1 RD-cost delta tips the NONE/HORZ/VERT comparison for this specific content+qindex.
- **Next step:** dump the port's per-candidate RD (NONE/HORZ/VERT) at the SB(0,0) 64×64 node vs
  the C reference. Needs an **encode-side RD-dump shim** — but `shim_encode_av1_kf` currently
  lives in the decoder-owned `dec_shim.c` and drives the opaque `aom_codec` API (no `cpi->sf`
  hook), so per-feature C-side toggling / RD dumps aren't reachable from the encoder track
  without a coordinated new shim entry point. Candidate speed-1 RD deltas to bisect once that
  exists: `perform_coeff_opt=2`, `tx_domain_dist_level/thres_level=1`, `adaptive_txb_search
  _level=2`, `top_intra_model_count_allowed=3`.
- **Two LATENT speed-1 bugs found while isolating (NOT this cell's cause — both leave these 8
  cells byte-identical, so no current test exercises them; documented for a future fix + new
  validation cells):**
  1. `part4_prune.rs:234` hardcodes `LEVEL_INDEX = 0`, but C's `ml_4_partition_search_level
     _index = min(speed,3)` (set 0/1/2/3 at `if(speed>=1/2/3)`, speed_features.c:210/237/271;
     default 0 at :2305). Index expr `(LEVEL*3+res_idx)*5+bsize_idx` uses LEVEL **directly**
     (no −1) — the port's `LEVEL_INDEX` == the level. Usage: `av1_ml_prune_4_partition`,
     partition_strategy.c:1507-1510. **CRITICAL caveat (verified 2026-07-15):** at level **3**
     (speed≥3) C flips `ml_model_index = (level<3) == 0` (partition_strategy.c:1359) → a
     **different NN model, no threshold table** (`:1472-1497`, scores vs `max_score−{500,500,200}`).
     So the port's table path is correct ONLY for speeds 0/1/2 (LEVEL 0/1/2). Fix = pass
     `level=min(speed,3)` from `cfg.speed` into `predict_4partition_prune` (caller
     partition_pick.rs:2173) and use it as the table row **only when level<3**; speed≥3 needs the
     alternate (old-NN, tableless) branch = a #10 item, NOT #25. Feeding LEVEL=3 into the table
     would be wrong (that path never runs in C).
  2. `tx_search.rs:1305` `get_search_init_depth_intra_speed0` hardcodes the speed-0
     `intra_tx_size_search_init_depth_rect = 0`, but C uses 1 at speed≥1 (speed_features.c:409);
     `_sqr = 1` for ALL speeds (unconditional at :367). So at speed≥1 BOTH rect and sqr return 1.
     `get_search_init_depth` (tx_search.c:363-383) returns `_rect` when w≠h, `_sqr` when w==h.
     Fix = thread `speed` into `choose_tx_size_type_from_rd_intra` (caller of the init-depth fn,
     tx_search.rs:1356; `TxfmYrdEnv` has no `speed` field yet — add it or pass a param) and return
     `rect = (speed>=1) as i32`, `sqr = 1`.
  Both preserve speed-0 exactly (min(0,3)=0; rect=0 at speed 0). Needs new speed-1 RECT-partition
  test cells to validate — the current speed-1 gates pass WITH the bugs (they don't reach a
  divergent 4-way-prune / rect-tx decision), so exercising cells must be discovered (a speed-1
  e2e harness exists: `encoder_gate_speed1_textured_allintra`).

### KB-4 — Encoder: bd10/bd12 coded-eob divergence (was "RD-decision divergence at high bit depth") — FIXED ✅ (BOTH roots; task #31)
- **FIXED 2026-07-16 (this landing) — OUTPUT_ENABLED tx_type_map copy semantics in `encode_b_intra_dry`.**
  The mono/4:2:0 aggressive-HF divergence (bd10 cq12, bd12 cq8, bd12 cq20 in
  `kb4_bd10_rd_localize.rs`) was NOT a high-bit-depth RD-scaling bug: the port ran C's single
  OUTPUT_ENABLED walk TWICE (the SB-root winner context/recon walk + the pack re-walk) with DRY
  (alias) tx_type_map semantics, so the first walk's `eob==0 → DCT_DCT` resets
  (encodemb.c:770-779, `update_txk_array`) leaked into the pack's re-quant input. A skip-winning
  txb (non-DCT search winner quantizing to eob 0 — exactly what aomenc codes) re-quantized as
  DCT_DCT with eob>0 in the coded bytes (e.g. the bd10 cq12 mi(14,12) BLOCK_16X8/D45 txb5:
  search=ADST_DCT/eob0, coded=DCT/eob1). C's semantics (`av1_update_state`,
  encodeframe_utils.c:217-231): DRY walks **ALIAS** `ctx->tx_type_map` — resets PERSIST into the
  stored winner map (real C behaviour; do NOT "fix" by cloning); OUTPUT_ENABLED **copies** ctx
  into the frame-level map and the resets land THERE, ctx untouched. **Fix:**
  `encode_b_intra_dry`/`encode_sb_dry` take `output_enabled`; the SB-root winner walk
  (partition_pick.rs, C partition_search.c:6010) and the pack walk (pack.rs — the same C walk,
  re-run) use a transient frame-map clone; the mid-candidate propagation (C :3613-3616) and
  non-SB winner walks (C :6023, `should_do_dry_run_encode_for_current_block` :5556 — last SPLIT
  children skipped) keep the alias. The `COracle`/`CPick` differential references mirror the
  split (they had shared the port's mis-model). bd10/12-amplified (larger RD magnitudes make
  non-DCT-eob0 near-tie txbs common) but NOT bd-specific in mechanism: the same leak closed
  KB-6's bd8 `quantizer-00 128×128 cq63` cell.
- **Prior "RD-DECISION layer bd scaling" localization REFUTED (2026-07-16):** per-tx_type
  rate+dist are byte-exact vs the REAL-C leaf chain (`kb4_txb2_probe.rs`); tx-type search order
  matches C (txk_map stays natural `{0..15}` at speed-0 — `prune_tx_2D` reorders only under
  `prune_tx_type_est_rd`, speed≥4); `ref_best_rd` threading and the `adaptive_txb_search` break
  match C, and the break never changed the winner on any divergent txb (with-break == full-eval
  on every one). The kernels were indeed byte-exact — the divergence was PASS-STRUCTURE, not
  arithmetic. (An earlier blanket per-pass-clone attempt regressed 3→5 cells because it also
  cloned C's DRY alias walks and the rd_pick CfL store-luma reencode — both must keep mutating.)
- **Gates:** mono/420 promoted to `kb4_gate_bd10_bd12_mono_hf_byte_match`
  (kb4_bd10_rd_localize.rs) — the full bd10/bd12 × cq8/12/20 × hf/ramp sweep byte-matches real
  aomenc (12/12). Non-420: the other KB-4 witness was FIXED separately by **1ecfafb** (AB HORZ_A
  nested sub-block reuse) — all 4 bd10 non-420 cells (444/422 × 64²/128² cq32) byte-match,
  asserted by `encoder_gate_bd10_non420_e2e_kb4_repro`.

### KB-5 — Encoder: lossless (cq0 / qindex 0) KEY encode — MONO FIXED ✅ (byte-exact, hard-asserted); 420 chroma RD near-tie remains
- **MONO FIXED 2026-07-16.** Mono 64² cq0 (coded-lossless allintra KEY) is now an end-to-end BYTE
  MATCH vs real aomenc, hard-asserted in `encoder_gate_lossless_cq0_e2e_kb5_repro`
  (encoder_gate_chroma_ss_e2e.rs). THREE fixes were required (the two originally localized below,
  plus a third found during landing):
  1. **Harness two-pass (#32):** `run_case` now mirrors the decoder's two-pass lossless probe —
     parse, compute coded_lossless from the probe's quant params (base_qindex==0 && all 5 plane
     q-deltas 0), re-parse with `cfg.coded_lossless/all_lossless=true`.
  2. **Forward WHT (#33):** `av1_fwht4x4` ported into aom-transform (bit-exact vs `av1_fwht4x4_c`,
     gated by `fwht4x4_diff`); `QuantParams` gained a `lossless` flag; `xform_quant` (lib.rs) and
     every encoder recon site (encode_intra / tx_search / intra_uv_rd) route coded-lossless TX_4X4
     through WHT/IWHT via `av1_inverse_transform_add(.., eob, lossless)`. The SATD fast model stays
     DCT (`av1_quick_txfm` forces lossless=0 in C — intra_uv_rd.rs:800 unchanged, do NOT "fix" it).
     The differential oracle (tests/common/mod.rs `c_search_tx_type_p` / `c_uniform_txfm_yrd`) uses
     `ref_fwht4x4`/`ref_highbd_iwht4x4_add` for lossless — a faithfulness correction (real C uses
     WHT for lossless, hybrid_fwd_txfm.c:83-86).
  3. **Entropy-context propagation (the actual byte-divergence root, found via decode-both
     localization `kb5_lossless_localize.rs`):** the WRITTEN `txb_skip_ctx`/`dc_sign_ctx` must
     derive from the REAL above/left neighbour entropy context ALWAYS — C's write path
     (`av1_write_coeffs_txb`, encodetxb.c:596-598) is never gated on the trellis; only C's
     trellis-local `ta/tl` fill is (encodemb.c:817-819). The port shared one ta/tl array for both
     uses (encode_intra.rs, luma + chroma arms) and seeded it from the real context only when the
     trellis was on; coded-lossless runs trellis-OFF (USE_B_QUANT_NO_TRELLIS), so a block with a
     coded left neighbour wrote ctx 1/0 instead of the real 3/1 and desynced the decoder. Fix:
     always seed ta/tl from the real neighbour context.
- **REMAINING (open, do not close KB-5 yet):** 4:2:0 cq0 diverges via a **≤1-rdcost-unit chroma RD
  near-tie** at the first 16×16 partition node (real picks SPLIT, port picks NONE; the port's child-3
  rdcost 63759 EXACTLY equals the budget, strict-< keeps NONE). KB-2/KB-6 class. Verified correct so
  far: chroma `cost_coeffs_txb` for large lossless coeffs (up to 3000), real-context usage, dist=0
  accumulation. Coverage gap: `txfm_uvrd_diff` never tests qindex 0 — a lossless chroma UV-RD
  differential (extending it to qindex 0, with the common/mod.rs UvRdEnv oracle path taught
  WHT-for-lossless like the yrd path was) is the next localization step, or C-side per-partition RD
  instrumentation ala KB-2. The gate keeps the 420 cell as an open characterization
  (`assert_open_divergence`) and hard-asserts mono — it FAILS the moment 420 starts matching
  (→ promote to full byte-match) or mono regresses.

### KB-6 — Encoder: REAL-content RD divergence at bd8 4:2:0 (PRIMARY config) — REAL, tracked, FIRST ROOT FIXED (luma re-encode), continuing
- **FIX #1 LANDED 2026-07-15 (ca2826f) — luma re-encode intra edge filter.** The luma analogue of
  #26 (chroma). `encode_b_intra_dry` — the dry-run re-encode used by BOTH the search's inter-strip
  context propagation (`partition_pick.rs:1054/1338/1914`) AND the pack output (`pack.rs:317`) — froze
  the LUMA intra edge filter at the SB-level `env.filter_type` (always 0) instead of the per-block
  `get_intra_edge_filter_type` (reconintra.c:974). KB-2 fixed only the luma SEARCH RD (leaf y_env); the
  re-encode/stamp stayed at 0. So an angled luma leaf (angle_delta≠0) with a SMOOTH above/left neighbour
  re-encoded its prediction with edge filter 0 not 1 → wrong residual → per-txb eob flip in the coded
  bytes, AND a wrong propagated entropy context that shifted later leaves' RD. **Fix:** carry the
  per-block `luma_edge_filter_type` (already computed in the search, KB-2) on `LeafWinner` and feed it to
  `encode_b_intra_dry`'s y_env. The `CPick` differential reference had to mirror it or diverge on
  smooth-neighbour angled leaves: `CEncPlaneArgs` gained a `filter_type` field so the `COracle`
  propagation re-predicts (ref_hbd_predict_intra 9th arg) with the SAME per-block filter. Localized via
  `kb6_real_rd_localize.rs` (decode-both-streams): first divergent SB was leaf mi(12,12) bsize=BLOCK_4X16
  angled (y_mode=6, angle_delta_y=1), real eob=0 vs port eob=2, ±1 recon at (48,48). Verified: full
  aom-encode suite green; `partition_pick_diff` green with randomized SMOOTH neighbours.
- **REMAINING (one axis).** Map (combined tree, MEASURED 2026-07-16 after the KB-4
  OUTPUT_ENABLED fix + the partial-SB chunk series): **26/30 byte-exact — the ONLY divergences
  left are 196×196 cq12/20/32/48** (the bottom-edge over-split near-tie, pinned below). Every
  interior-crop cell now matches: size-64×64 all 6 cq (cq5/12/20/48/63 with FIX #1; cq32 with
  1ecfafb — AB HORZ_A nested sub-block reuse); quantizer-64² 6/6, film-64² 6/6, quantizer-128²
  6/6 — the former cq5 low-q cluster and the quantizer-128² cq12/20/32 near-ties cleared with
  the partial-SB chunk series' distortion-clip landings, and **quantizer-128² cq63 + 196×196
  cq63 closed 2026-07-16 by the KB-4 OUTPUT_ENABLED tx_type_map fix** (the port coded DCT-eob1
  where real codes an eob0 skip — the reset-leak signature, present in interior AND edge SB
  rows).
- **DISTINCT SUB-GAP — partial-SB (frame dims not a multiple of 64px) — FIXED except ONE cell
  (196² cq48).** Landed: the CHUNK series (`3167800` CHUNK 0+1 true-frame harness + luma visible
  dist clip, `7c468ee` CHUNK 2 chroma visible clips via `max_block_units`, `4b8b1f1` CHUNK 3
  `set_partition_cost_for_edge_blk`), the KB-4 OUTPUT_ENABLED tx_type_map reset-leak fix
  (`a2dd28e`, closed 196² cq63), and the **frame-edge entropy-stamp tail-zero + frame-init edge
  partition CDF fix** (closed cq12/20/32; map 26/30 → **29/30**). That last root was pinned by a
  full C-vs-port symbol-level bit trace (throwaway instrumented sibling C at `/root/kb6-edge-instr`,
  byte-gate-verified vs real aomenc): the apparent "mi(48,0) 16×8-vs-8×4 over-split" was NOT a
  search decision — the port's search picks C's EXACT tree and every leaf RD matches C to the unit;
  the port's PACK also writes the same symbols. The divergence was a WRITE-side probability defect:
  (a) **`av1_set_entropy_contexts` (blockd.c:29) zeroes the beyond-visible TAIL of an edge txb's
  above/left entropy-context footprint** (`memset(a + above_contexts, 0, txs_wide - above_contexts)`)
  while the port's tile stamp (encode_sb.rs) wrote the cul across the FULL footprint — phantom
  nonzero culs at out-of-frame mi cols (50-51 luma / 25 chroma) fed later edge blocks'
  full-footprint `get_txb_ctx` reads, flipping SB(32,48)'s txb_skip_ctx (1→3 luma, 8→9 U) → same
  symbols on different-probability cdf rows → +3 bits → stream desync at tile-byte 975 → the
  decoded "over-split" artifact; (b) the CHUNK 3 edge partition-cost gather read the SB-adapted
  partition CDF, but C's `set_partition_cost_for_edge_blk` (partition_search.c:3415) reads
  **`cm->fc` — the frame-init table** (measured: C's gather rows == `default_partition_cdf`),
  a shipped-libaom mixed-source quirk (interior costs track the adapting tile state; edge gather
  does not). Note the C encode-path per-txb stamp `av1_set_txb_context` (encodemb.h) is
  full-footprint UNclipped — only the tokenize/persistent stamp clips; the port's local ta/tl
  stamps correctly mirror the former and needed no change.
  **196² cq5/12/20/32/63 are asserted byte-match gates** in `encoder_gate_real_image_e2e_kb6_repro`.
  **RESIDUAL (pinned, assert-diverge in `kb6_characterize_196_partial_sb`, now targeting cq48):**
  196² cq48 (qindex 192) diverges at tile-byte 253 of ~609/616 — MID-stream (SB rows 1-2), NOT the
  bottom-row-boundary signature the fixed cells had — a distinct near-tie, next localization
  target (decode-both on the current tree).
- **MULTI-TILE encode is byte-exact** (commit f6e6319, `encoder_gate_multitile_e2e`): the port's own
  per-tile search+pack byte-matches real aomenc across 2×1/1×2/2×2 grids (4:4:4 128² × cq{12,32,63}).
- **DISCOVERED 2026-07-15 via the new real-image e2e gate** (`encoder_gate_real_image_e2e_kb6_repro`
  in `encoder_gate_chroma_ss_e2e.rs`): decode the first KEY frame of a small conformance vector
  (`av1-1-b8-01-size-64x64`, `av1-1-b8-01-size-196x196`; `01-size` is in CI's intra fetch scope) to
  genuine YUV via the C decode oracle, then run the port's full encode vs real aomenc byte-for-byte on
  those REAL pixels. **Every synthetic e2e gate is byte-exact, but genuine image content diverges
  across the whole quality range.** Map (bd8 4:2:0, cq5..63): the multi-SB **196×196 frame diverges at
  EVERY cq** (e.g. cq20 port tile 1457B vs real 1556B — port codes ~100 FEWER bytes); the 1-SB
  **64×64 diverges at cq5/12/32/48** and byte-matches only at the coincidental cq20/cq63. 2/12 cells
  byte-exact, 10 diverge. (Superseded by FIX #1 above: after the luma re-encode fix + the expanded
  photographic/film crop gate, the map is now 15/30 byte-exact.)
- **Signature = KB-2 class:** the port codes FEWER symbols than aomenc ⇒ it makes different (cheaper)
  partition/mode/tx RD decisions — a near-tie flip, exactly like KB-2 (`get_intra_edge_filter_type`)
  and KB-3 (speed-1 rect-kill), but now on the **PRIMARY bd8 4:2:0 speed-0 KEY** path and on REAL
  content. The hand-tuned synthetic patterns (diag/vbars/vgrad/tex_*) never exercised the diverging
  decision; real photographic/screen statistics do. **This means the "byte-exact regime: bd8 all
  content" note under KB-4 is TRUE ONLY for the synthetic gates — it is FALSE for real content.**
- **Root cause: MULTIPLE KB-2-class near-ties, several roots landed.** FIX #1 (luma re-encode
  edge filter) took real 64×64 from 2/6 to 5/6; 1ecfafb (AB HORZ_A nested reuse) closed 64×64 cq32
  + the 4 bd10 non-420 KB-4 cells; the partial-SB chunk series (distortion visible-clips + edge
  partition cost) cleared the cq5 low-q cluster + the quantizer-128² cq12/20/32 near-ties + 196²
  cq5; the KB-4 OUTPUT_ENABLED tx_type_map fix (2026-07-16) closed quantizer-128² cq63 + 196²
  cq63. Only the 196² bottom-edge over-split (cq12/20/32/48) remains — same class (a speed-0 RD
  near-tie tipped by an edge/neighbour/rounding/pass-structure difference).
- **Repro (COMMITTED, CI-green characterization):** `encoder_gate_real_image_e2e_kb6_repro` prints the
  full per-cell MATCH/MISMATCH map, asserts a byte-exact CONTROL (64×64 cq20 — harness-faithfulness +
  regression guard), and asserts the KB-6 divergence is still PRESENT (gates: when the port becomes
  byte-exact on real content the test FAILS → promote it to a full `report_and_assert` byte-match
  gate). Not a weakened test — the correct end state is full byte-identity on real content.
- **Next step (localization):** the ONLY remaining KB-6 target is the **196×196 bottom-edge
  over-split** (cq12/20/32/48; pinned in `kb6_characterize_196_partial_sb`): the mi(48,0)
  HORZ-vs-SPLIT distortion-side near-tie on the 8px-visible strip — run the sibling-C
  per-candidate RD dump (KB-2/KB-3 methodology) at that 16×16 node, find the tipping term, fix
  it KB-2/KB-3-style. Close ONLY by a landed fix that makes real content byte-match — never by
  weakening or by narrowing the corpus.
- **Priority note:** KB-6 hits the single most common real-world case (bd8 4:2:0 photographic content
  at web qindex), so it is arguably higher-impact than the bd10/bd12 (KB-4) and lossless (KB-5)
  corners. Sequencing is the coordinator's call.

### KB-7 — Encoder: `--cpu-used=3` cq12 4:2:0 partition near-tie exposed by the (correct) chroma HOG — REAL, KB-6 class, pinned
- **Symptom:** in `encoder_gate_speed3_textured_allintra` (Gate-2 cpu-used=3), 3 of 64 cells diverge
  from real aomenc — `two-tone 64x64`, `two-tone 128x128`, `vgrad 128x128`, all **cq12 (qindex 48)
  4:2:0**. All 32 mono cells + all cq32/48/63 4:2:0 cells byte-match (61/64). Localized
  (decode-both, port decoder is bit-exact): a SB-root **partition flip** — real picks BLOCK_64X64
  NONE, the port splits — driven by the chroma RD, only at low q.
- **Root cause: NOT the speed-3 chroma HOG port (that is bit-exact).** The speed-3 delta
  `chroma_intra_pruning_with_hog = 2` (speed_features.c:454) is correctly ported: the chroma HOG mask
  (`prune_intra_mode_with_hog_uv`, hog.rs) is proven **byte-identical to C** across 900 cases (all
  bd/subsampling/edge-clip combos — `prune_intra_mode_with_hog_uv_matches_c`), and its inputs are the
  same offset/dims the (correct) chroma encode uses. Turning it ON fixed **13 of the 16** cq12+cq32
  4:2:0 cells that diverged before it. The residual 3 are a **pre-existing latent chroma-RD near-tie**
  (KB-6 class — the aggressive-web low-q regime KB-6 flags): the correct HOG shrinks the chroma mode
  set enough that a chroma-RD near-tie tips the NONE-vs-split partition. Same mechanism as KB-2/KB-6
  (a mode-set-shrinking delta exposes a latent RD tie), on the chroma partition path.
- **Next chunk (localization):** decode-both per-SB at `two-tone 64x64 420 cq12` (1-SB, simplest);
  the port's split vs real's NONE at mi(0,0) is the flip. Dump the port's NONE-candidate chroma RD vs
  the sibling C's for the 64×64 (and its 32×32 SPLIT children) to find the chroma-RD term that
  differs at qindex 48. Fix KB-2/KB-6-style, then promote the 3 pinned cells in
  `encoder_gate_speed3_textured_allintra` into the byte-match claim. Close ONLY by a landed fix —
  the gate PINS the exact residual set, so it FAILS the moment one starts matching (prompting
  promotion) or a new cell regresses.

### KB-8 — Encoder: `--cpu-used=4` speed-4 deltas — PORTED ✅ (59/64; luma byte-exact; 5 KB-7-class chroma near-ties pinned)
- **Status (2026-07-16): every documented speed-4 delta is PORTED + LIVE — 59/64 cells byte-identical**
  vs real aomenc (`encoder_gate_speed4_textured_allintra`, {64,128}² × cq{12,32,48,63} ×
  {flat,two-tone,vgrad,diag} × {mono,420}), up from 35/64 baseline → 51/64 (chunk 1 series) →
  59/64 (the winner-mode flip). **ALL 32 mono cells byte-match — the speed-4 LUMA path is
  byte-exact.** The 5 pinned residuals are 4:2:0 chroma near-ties of the **KB-7 class** (KB-7's
  speed-3 pins are the SAME content cells at cq12): `diag 128² cq12`, `two-tone 64² cq12`,
  `two-tone 64² cq32`, `vgrad 128² cq12`, `vgrad 64² cq12` — the latent chroma-RD low-q near-tie
  tracked under KB-7, NOT a missing speed-4 delta. When KB-7's chroma root lands, re-check +
  promote these 5.
- **The full landed chunk series (each verified on origin/main):**
  1. `prune_chroma_modes_using_luma_winner` + NON_DUAL LF search (e8c662f, 51/64).
  2. SATD trellis-skip body `skip_trellis_opt_based_on_satd` (16d4d85) — unit-tested vs REAL C
     (`ref_satd` = exported `aom_satd_c`).
  3. Stage-aware `TxTypeSearchPolicy` derivation (7bd30fb) — MODE_EVAL/WINNER_MODE_EVAL coeff-opt
     + tx-domain columns per `set_mode_eval_params`, validated vs the C tables.
  4. `USE_LARGESTALL` tx-size arm (42bdffc) — `choose_largest_tx_size` demotion tables verified vs C.
  5. `use_default_intra_tx_type` in `get_tx_mask_intra` (96eeb71) + threading (9c6ed2a) —
     differential vs the C shim across use_default × screen sweeps.
  6. Winner-mode two-pass skeleton in `rd_pick_intra_sby_mode_y` (0ee9f97) — `store_winner_mode_
     stats` C-semantics unit-tested; `use_rd_based_breakout` rd_thresh (AOMMIN) in the depth loop.
  7. Est-rd tx-type prune (264bba4) — `av1_cost_coeffs_txb_laplacian` (REAL-C differential across
     15,960 cases) + `prune_txk_type` + txk_map reorder; LIVE on intra in the WINNER pass.
  8. THE FLIP (this landing): `set_allintra(4)` real values (`perform_coeff_opt=5`,
     `tx_domain_dist_thres_level=3`, `fast_intra_tx_type_search=2`, `winner_mode_tx_type_pruning=2`,
     `prune_2d_txfm_mode=PRUNE_3`, `prune_tx_type_est_rd=1`, `enable_winner_mode_for_{coeff_opt,
     use_tx_domain_dist,tx_size_srch}=1`, `multi_winner_mode_type=MULTI_WINNER_MODE_DEFAULT(=2)`);
     `use_rd_based_breakout_for_intra_tx_search=1` at speed>=3 (:460 — speed-3 gate re-verified
     61/64, empirical no-op confirmed); the two-pass wiring in `partition_pick.rs` (per-leaf
     `WinnerModeCfg` derivation); BOTH split-info prunes (`prune_ext_part_using_split_info`:
     the AB `evaluate_ab_partition_based_on_split` at level 2 = speed>=4 — inert at qindex>=128
     by its threshold formula — and the 4-way `prune_4_partition_using_split_info` at level 1 =
     speed>=3, via `split_part_rect_win` rect-win threading through the SPLIT recursion).
- **Key facts for future speeds (verified against source):** `top_intra_model_count_allowed` stays
  **3** at speed 4 (the `=2` drop is speed>=5, :533); `MULTI_WINNER_MODE_DEFAULT=2` / `FAST=1`
  (speed_features.h:226/230), `winner_mode_count_allowed={1,2,3}`; the AB split-info threshold
  `min(3*(2*(MAXQ-q)/MAXQ),3)` is 3 for q<=127 / 0 for q>=128; C's chroma search runs DEFAULT_EVAL
  (rdopt.c:3659 resets right after the luma two-pass); the winner re-eval (`intra_block_yrd`) gets
  NO ALLINTRA variance factor yet compares vs the factored first-pass best_rd (C asymmetry,
  preserved); C's LARGESTALL arm bypasses `uniform_txfm_yrd`'s rate assembly — equivalent to it
  with `tx_mode_is_select=false` (tx_size_rate=0), which is how the port models it.
- **Gate PINS the 5-cell residual set exactly** — FAILS on any promotion (→ promote) or regression.

## Encoder single-frame primary envelope (VERIFIED against reference/libaom)

Primary config = ALLINTRA (usage=2), speed-0 KEY frame. libaom's own allintra tuning
(`av1/av1_cx_iface.c:3065`) sets these **defaults** — so matching them, NOT the base defaults,
is what "single-frame exact" means:

- **CDEF: OFF** by default in allintra ("CDEF has been found to blur images, so it's disabled
  in all-intra mode"). Only `--enable-cdef` turns it on.
- **Loop-restoration: OFF** by default in allintra.
- **QM: OFF** by default in allintra. CORRECTED 2026-07-15 (the prior "QM: ON" claim was WRONG —
  it conflated the qm_min/max override with `enable_qm`). The allintra override at
  `av1_cx_iface.c:3065` sets `qm_min=4`/`qm_max=10` but does NOT assign `enable_qm`, which stays
  at its base default `0` (`:290/447`); `using_qm = enable_qm` (`:1310`). qm_min/max are INERT
  unless QM is turned on by `--enable-qm` (`:2076`) or `tune=IQ`/`SSIMULACRA2` (`:1946`).
  Empirical proof: the passing `encoder_gate_e2e_*` gates byte-match the port with `qm=None` —
  impossible if the reference allintra encodes were QM-on.
- screen_detection_mode = ANTIALIASING_AWARE.

**What the encoder track has byte-matched (`encoder_gate_e2e_*`):** own-search partition / mode /
tx / coefficients + LF-level derivation, in a **CDEF-off + restoration-off + QM-off** reference
encode (`shim encode_av1_kf`, cdef/restoration/qm passed as explicit params). This envelope
MATCHES the allintra defaults for CDEF, restoration, AND QM (all off). The frame HEADER is still
bootstrapped from the real parse (qindex, tile info, cdf-update, ...) — only LF-level is
port-derived.

**Remaining for single-frame-PRIMARY exactness (blocks "all single frame exactly"):**
- **KB-2 (#22) cq62 speed-0 — FIXED ✅ (74fb582)**: per-block `get_intra_edge_filter_type`
  recompute in `partition_pick.rs` (a SMOOTH neighbour was not raising the angled-prediction edge
  filter → model-RD over-pruned V_PRED adj=−1 → flipped SB(32,32) partition). cq62 byte-matches +
  asserted in `encoder_gate_e2e_rich_content_strong_lf`. See the KB-2 FIXED block above.
- **#25 two latent speed-1 bugs — DONE ✅** (verified 2026-07-15): both are fixed in source
  (parameterized, no longer hardcoded 0) — `part4_prune.rs` takes a `level_index` param
  (`min(speed,3)`, with the `>=3` alternate-branch guard) and `tx_search.rs` takes an
  `intra_tx_size_init_depth_rect` field — and the asserted per-feature-revert witness
  `encoder_gate_speed1_rect_and_4way_25` (in `encoder_gate_e2e_byte_match.rs`) re-diverges if either
  fix is reverted. (Earlier "need test cells to validate" note was stale.)
- **#10 cpu-used 0..9 speed-feature sweep** (Gate 2) — the large remaining item.
  (#8 qindex-from-cq and #21 decoder q62/q63 are DONE + CI-green — no longer remaining.)

**Confirmed NON-divergences (ruled out — do not re-chase):**
- **#27 `model_based_prune_tx_search_level`.** `av1_set_speed_features_qindex_dependent` sets it
  to 0 for `{<720p, base_qindex ≤ thresh}` while the port keeps 1, but the field is **inter-only**:
  the C consumer gate lives in `av1_pick_recursive_tx_size_type_yrd` behind `is_inter_block`, so it
  is inert on the all-intra KEY path and the port never reads it. `prune_tx_size_level` is inter-only
  the same way. Coordinator independently confirmed both. Empirical guard: the new asserted
  `encoder_gate_e2e_low_qindex_speed0` (cq8–30 → qindex 32–120, 12 cells) byte-matches end-to-end
  with the field left at 1 — the previously-untested aggressive-web low-q regime is now covered.

**NOT blocking single-frame-primary (non-default single-frame knobs — these ARE single-frame work
to be done before "the rest"=inter-frame, but lower priority than the primary default config):**
- **#23 QM-on encode** — reclassified here 2026-07-15 (QM is OFF by default, per the corrected
  line above). Only reached by `--enable-qm` / `tune=IQ`/`SSIMULACRA2`. Forward-quant +
  `wt_matrix` table; decoder QM decode already ported. Gate-4 knob coverage, not a primary hole.
- **#7 CDEF-strength RD search** — off by default in allintra; only for explicit `--enable-cdef`.
  Building blocks exist as shims (`cdef_find_dir`, `cdef_filter_8/16`, `shim_encode_cdef`).
- **Loop-restoration (Wiener/SGR) search** — off by default in allintra; only for explicit
  `--enable-restoration`.

## Coordination (parallel tracks)

- Max clean parallelism = **2** (one decoder agent + one encoder agent); cargo's shared
  target-dir lock serializes builds, which keeps the box safe.
- Strict crate ownership; commit with **explicit per-file staging** (`git add <paths>`, never
  `-A`/`-u`/`.`); shared `STATUS.md` via `git add -p`. Push `git push origin HEAD:main`; verify
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/main`.
- Coordinator independently verifies every landing (on origin, boundary-clean, no `#[ignore]`
  / weakened asserts, gate is a real byte-identity assertion, CI green). Never trust a claim.
