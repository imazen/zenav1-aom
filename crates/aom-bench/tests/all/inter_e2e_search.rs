//! INTER-ENCODE chunk 2f/2g — THE END-TO-END SEARCH GATE for the §3
//! low-delay zero-MV P: the port's OWN partition search CHOOSES the inter
//! blocks (`PickFrameCfg::inter` → `rd_pick_inter_mode_sb` competing against
//! the intra winner at every leaf) and the packed frame-1 OBU payload must be
//! BYTE-IDENTICAL to `aomenc`'s.
//!
//! This is the rung the pack-only gate (`inter_pack_tile_diff.rs`) could not
//! claim: there the tile was hand-assembled from the measured block layout;
//! here `pack_tile` runs the real RD loop end-to-end and nothing block-level
//! is copied from the reference. The measured ground truth (instrumented
//! libaom decoder): the zero-MV P codes one `PARTITION_NONE` 64x64
//! `NEARESTMV (LAST)` skip block per superblock.
//!
//! ## Honest bootstrap (unchanged contract)
//!
//! Sequence template + the recon-dependent frame-1 header tail (LF, CDEF,
//! frame `interp_filter`) come from the reference stream, exactly as the
//! KEY-frame `port_encode` bootstraps its header; `base_qindex` is derived
//! and cross-checked. The TILE — the part this gate exists for — is derived
//! from nothing.
//!
//! ## Failure diagnostics
//!
//! On a byte mismatch the test rebuilds the port's full 2-frame stream
//! (frame payloads substituted into the reference framing) and runs the
//! decode-both localizer, printing the first divergent (frame, SB, sample)
//! before panicking.

///
/// ## Measured facts (2026-07-23, instrumented C at the pinned v3.14.1 SHA)
///
/// 1. The §3 GOOD-mode stream codes **SB128** (`mib_size_log2 = 5` — libaom's
///    GOOD default at every speed), NOT SB64. A 64x128 frame is ONE
///    column-cropped 128x128 superblock whose root codes a gathered 2-way
///    SPLIT/VERT partition symbol (`write_partition`'s `has_rows && !has_cols`
///    arm) before the two visible 64x64 children. The old "two-superblock
///    tile" framing (and `inter_pack_tile_diff.rs`'s hand-rolled SB64 pin) was
///    WRONG about the walk shape; a 64x64 frame is degenerate (both walks emit
///    identical symbols), which is why the single-SB gates match either way.
///    `port_encode_inter_p` now drives the declared SB size.
/// 2. At the cropped root C evaluates SPLIT (rd 248,444,575; children rd
///    133,585,034 + 102,885,701, both NEARESTMV skip) then VERT. VERT's single
///    64x128 sub-block FAILS: `av1_txfm_search`'s final skip-guard
///    (tx_search.c:3893) computes tmprd 250,728,413 > the remaining budget
///    247,851,864 (SPLIT minus the VERT partition bit) → no codeable
///    candidate → SPLIT wins in C.
/// 3. The 64x128 candidate is over-priced because of the INTERP-FILTER search:
///    during encoding the frame filter is SWITCHABLE (the coded REGULAR header
///    value is a POST-encode selection), so every inter candidate pays
///    `rs = av1_get_switchable_rate(..)`. `use_more_sharp_interp = 1`
///    (speed_features.c:1139, GOOD base at EVERY speed, non-boosted frames)
///    gives SHARP a `mul = 90` (10%) RD discount in `interpolation_filter_rd`
///    (interp_search.c) — on the dist-heavy 64x128 model RD the discount lets
///    SHARP displace REGULAR, and its rate at ctx 3 is 3931 vs REGULAR's 109.
///    The children (smaller model RD) keep REGULAR (rs 109 each).
/// 4. The port models NO interp-filter rate on the inter arm (rs = 0), so its
///    64x128 VERT leaf is ~3822 rate units cheaper than C's and WINS the root:
///    port tile `[d7, a0]` (VERT, one block) vs aomenc `[f2, 24, 80]` (SPLIT,
///    two blocks).
///
/// ## The fix (next rung, bounded)
///
/// Model the §3 interp-filter search on the inter arm: the CURVFIT model-rd
/// (`MODELRD_TYPE_INTERP_FILTER = MODELRD_CURVFIT`, model_rd.h:31 — NOT the
/// ported lapndz model; needs `av1_model_rd_curvfit` + tables + a
/// differential), `av1_get_pred_context_switchable_interp`, the
/// switchable-interp cost table, and `interpolation_filter_rd`'s biased
/// accept (`tmp_rd * mul / 100 < *rd`, SHARP mul=90). At zero MV every
