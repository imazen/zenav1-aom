//! aom-quant — bit-exact AV1 quantization kernels (port of libaom v3.14.1).
//!
//! Validated byte-for-byte against the C reference by differential harnesses in
//! `tests/`. Starts with the `av1_quantize_fp` family (the encoder fast-path
//! quantizer, no quant-matrix), which is the stage directly downstream of the
