//! Differential harness for the forward 4x4 reversible Walsh–Hadamard transform
//! `av1_fwht4x4` — the coded-lossless (`xd->lossless`) forward transform (KB-5 /
//! task #33). Two independent proofs:
//!
//!  1. **C-oracle exactness** — the port's [`av1_fwht4x4`] must equal libaom
//!     v3.14.1's real exported `av1_fwht4x4_c` (via [`c::ref_fwht4x4`]) element
//!     for element, across random residuals, several input strides, and the full
//!     bd8 / bd12 / int16 magnitude ranges. This is the gold-standard evidence
//!     (real exported C fn), not a transcription cross-check.
//!  2. **Forward→inverse round-trip** — `av1_highbd_iwht4x4_add(av1_fwht4x4(r))`
//!     applied onto a mid-gray prediction must reconstruct `pred + r` exactly for
//!     in-range pixels (the `*UNIT_QUANT_FACTOR` forward scale and the inverse's
//!     `>> UNIT_QUANT_SHIFT` cancel, and the butterflies are reversible). Drives
//!     BOTH inverse branches: the DC-only (`eob <= 1`) special case and the full
//!     16-point transform (`eob > 1`).
