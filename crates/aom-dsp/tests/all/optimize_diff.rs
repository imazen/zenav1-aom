//! Differential harness for `av1_optimize_txb` (the coefficient trellis, non-QM
//! path) vs C libaom: identical random (tcoeff, qcoeff, dqcoeff, eob, cost
//! tables, dequant, rdmult, dc_sign/skip ctx, sharpness) inputs must produce
//! byte-identical optimized qcoeff / dqcoeff, the same reduced eob, and the same
//! rate. `get_tx_type_cost` (plane-0 tx_type rate) is out of scope on both sides.
