//! Differential harness for `av1_optimize_txb` on the *quant-matrix* path vs C
//! libaom: identical random (tcoeff, qcoeff, dqcoeff, eob, cost tables, dequant,
//! rdmult, ctx, sharpness, qm, iqm) inputs must produce byte-identical optimized
//! qcoeff/dqcoeff, the same reduced eob, and the same rate. The C oracle reaches
//! the real trellis body threaded with the real get_dqv/get_coeff_dist inlines
//! (iqm folds the dequant, qm folds the distortion).
//!
//! Coefficient magnitudes and dequant steps are bounded so the squared `diff*qm`
//! in get_coeff_dist stays within i64 (the regime real encoder coefficients live
//! in — large weights pair with small high-frequency coeffs).
